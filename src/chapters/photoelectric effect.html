			<h5>PARTICLE NATURE OF LIGHT</h5>
			<p>
				The photoelectric effect occurs when light is shone on a metals surface and this causes the metal to emit electrons.<br />
					<table>
						<tr class="white">
							<td><img src="img/photoelectric diagram1.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-rounded img-responsive"/></td>
						</tr><tr>
							<td>Metals are bonded in such a way that they share their valence electrons in a sea of delocalized electrons. In order to get an electron to be removed from the surface of a metal, you would have to provide it with enough energy in order to escape the bond.</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					The energy that light provides enables the electron to escape and this phenomenon is called photoelectric effect.
				</p>

					<h6>PHOTON ENERGY</h6>
					<table>
						Photons are “little packets” of energy called quanta, which act as particles. The energy of the photon(light) can be calculated in one of two ways:
						<tr class="fraction">
							<td><img src="img/photoelectric diagram2.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-rounded img-responsive"/></td>
							<td><img src="img/photoelectric diagram3.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td  colspan="2">E = energy of the photon measured in Joules (J)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td  colspan="2">h = Planck’s constant, 6,63 × 10<sup>−34</sup> (J·s)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td  colspan="2">f = frequency measured in hertz (Hz)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td  colspan="2">λ = wavelength measured in meters (m)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td  colspan="2">c = speed of light, 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> (m·s<sup>−1</sup>)</td>
						</tr>
					</table>

					<p>
						<h6>THRESHOLD FREQUENCY (f<sub>0</sub>), WORK FUNCTION (W<sub>0</sub>) AND ELECTRON ENERGY</h6>
						The frequency required to produce enough energy to emit an electron is called
						the threshold frequency (f<sub>0</sub>).<strong> The threshold frequency (f<sub>0</sub>) is the minimum
						frequency of incident radiation at which electrons will be emitted from
						a particular metal. The minimum amount of energy needed to emit an
						electron from the surface of a metal is known as the work function
						(W<sub>0</sub>)</strong>. The work function is material specific.<br /><br />
						If the energy of the photons exceed the work function (i.e. the frequency of light
						exceeds the threshold frequency), the excess energy is transferred to the liberated
						electron in the form of kinetic energy.<br /><br />
						The kinetic energy of the electron can be determined by:<br />
						<table>
							<tr>
								<th>E = W<sub>0</sub> + E<sub>K(max)</sub></th>
								<th>W<sub>0</sub> = hf<sub>0</sub></th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td colspan="2"  class="white"><img src="img/photoelectric diagram4.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/></td>
							</tr>
							<tr><td colspan="2">Sometimes work function is given in eV. Convert from eV to J:<br /> J = eV &times; 1,6&times;10<sup>-19</sup></td></tr>
						</table>
					</p>

					<p>
						<h6>FREQUENCY AND WAVELENGTH</h6>
						An increase in frequency will increase the kinetic energy of
						the electrons. On a graph of E<sub>k(max)</sub> vs frequency, the
						y-intercept indicates the threshold frequency.<br />
						<img src="img/photoelectric diagram5.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/><br />
						Similarly, on the graph of  E<sub>k(max)</sub> vs wavelength, the
						y-intercept indicates the maximum wavelength of light
						that can emit an electron (wavelength is inversely proportional
						to frequency).
						<img src="img/photoelectric diagram6.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/><br />
					</p>

					<p>
						<h6>INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY</h6>
						Increasing the intensity (brightness) of the light (radiation) means that there are more photons with the same frequency. This
						will result in more electrons with the same amount of energy being emitted. Thus the number of electrons emitted per second
						increases with the intensity of the incident radiation<br />
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td><img src="img/photoelectric diagram7.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td class="white"><img src="img/photoelectric diagram8.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><img src="img/photoelectric diagram9.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/></td>
							</tr>
						</table><br /><br />
						Note that the energy of the electrons remain the same. If the frequency of the incident radiation is below the cut-off frequency,
						then increasing the intensity of the radiation has no effect i.e. it does not cause electrons to be ejected. To increase the energy,
						the frequency of the radiant light needs to be increased.<br /><br />
						<ul>
							<li>INCREASE INTENSITY AT CONSTANT <strong>FREQUENCY</strong> = INCREASE <strong>AMOUNT</strong> OF EMITTED ELECTRONS</li>
							<li>INCREASE FREQUENCY AT CONSTANT <strong>INTENSITY</strong> = INCREASE <strong>KINETIC ENERGY</strong> OF EMITTED ELECTRONS</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
						<h6>INTENSITY, FREQUENCY AND CURRENT</h6>
						The higher the intensity of the radiation, the more electrons are emitted per
						second. Therefore an increased intensity will increase the current produced.<br /><br />
						The higher the frequency, the more kinetic energy is provided to the same number
						of electrons. The rate of electron flow <i>REMAINS THE SAME.</i><br />
						<img src="img/photoelectric diagram10.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/>
					</p>

					<p>
						<h6>CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM</h6>
						When white light shines through a prism, the light is dispersed into a
						spectrum of light. It is called the continuous spectrum. White light is
						made up of all the colours of the spectrum, and when dispersed we are
						able to see the components of white light. This is the same range as the
						visible spectrum.<br />
						<img src="img/photoelectric diagram11.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/>
						<br />The white light is emitted from a bulb, therefore the continuous spectrum is an
						emission spectrum.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h6>ATOMIC EMISSION SPECTRA</h6>
						When an element in the gaseous phase is heated, it emits light. If the
						light produced is passed through a prism, a spectrum is produced. However,
						this spectrum is not continuous, but consists of only some lines of
						colour. This is known as <strong>line emission spectrum</strong>.<br /><br />
						Each element has their own light signature as no two elements have the
						same spectrum.
						<!-- Image of the different light signature of different elements -->
					</p>

					<p>
						<h6>ENERGY LEVELS</h6>
						The lines on the atomic spectrum (line emission spectrum) are as a result
						of electron transitions between energy levels. As electrons gain energy
						(heat) they transition to a higher state of energy, hence a higher energy
						level. As the element cools the electrons drop back down to the lower
						energy state. As they do this they emit the absorbed energy in the form of
						light (photons). Therefore, each electron gives off a frequency of light
						which corresponds with the line emission spectrum.<br /><br />
						<img src="img/photoelectric diagram12.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/>
						<br />Electrons in the n = 1 energy level are closest to the nucleus and have the
						lowest potential energy. Electrons in the energy level furthest from the nucleus
						(eg. n = 4) has the highest potential energy. If an electron is free
						from the atom then it has zero potential energy. The potential energy is
						given as a negative value due to a decrease in potential as the electrons
						get close to the nucleus.<br /><br />
						As the electrons transition from their energized state back to their normal
						state they give off energy that is equal to the difference in potential energy
						between the energy levels.<br />

						<table>
							<tr>
								<td>ΔE = E<sub>2</sub> − E<sub>1</sub></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>ΔE = difference in potential energy between two energy levels</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>E<sub>2</sub> = the highest energy state</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>E<sub>1</sub> = the lowest energy state</td>
							</tr>
						</table><br />
						The amount of energy that is released relates directly to a specific frequency
						or wavelength (thus colour) of light.
						<table>
							<tr>
								<td>E = hf</td>
								<td><img src="img/photoelectric diagram13.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/></td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong><br />
							A sample of hydrogen gas is placed in a discharge tube. The electron
							from the hydrogen atom emits energy as it transitions from energy level
							E<sub>6</sub> (−0,61×10<sup>−19</sup> J) to E<sub>2</sub> (−5,46×10<sup>−19</sup> J). Determine the wavelength of
							light emitted.

					</p>

					<p>
						<h6>ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTRA</h6>
						As white light is passed through a cold gaseous element,
						the electrons inside the atoms of the element absorb the
						energy of the light (photons). The energy is absorbed in
						specific bands which corresponds to the energy required
						by electrons to transition between energy levels.<br /><br />
						The absorbed energy furthermore corresponds to a
						specific frequency of light. As the electrons absorb
						energy, the specific frequency of light disappears, resulting
						in an absorption spectrum. The black lines below represent
						the energy absorbed by the element.<br />
						<img src="img/photoelectric diagram16.png" alt="Thumbnail Image" class="img-responsive"/>
						<br />The absorption spectra for a specific element will be the
						inverse of its emission spectra.<br />
